🌸 Iris Flower Classification 🌸
📌 Overview
The Iris Flower Classification is a well-known machine learning problem used to classify iris flowers into one of three species:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
This project utilizes the Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples with 4 features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
🎯 Objective
The goal is to build a classification model that can predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

📂 Dataset
The dataset is available in the sklearn.datasets module and can also be downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Library)
Pandas (Data Manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (Development Environment)
📌 Steps Involved
Data Loading: Importing the Iris dataset
Data Exploration: Checking features, target labels, and summary statistics
Data Visualization: Using scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots
Model Selection: Choosing classification algorithms like:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Model Training & Evaluation: Splitting the dataset, training models, and measuring accuracy
Predictions: Making predictions on new flower measurements
🔧 Installation & Usage
